When there's groups of people, each member of the group is holding a portion, and in terms of the Reed Solomon... We are going to have to consider the number of people in the group and the number of people that have to be online at any time to recover that data. \n\nI think we should be looking at something like 60%. When we add and remove group members, we probably have to look at real time ordering of the data. But we have to do that intelligently. So can we think deeply about this component? "

We want to show things like the new internet that we're talking about\u2014specifically a markdown internet with the forward addressing mechanism. \n\nAlso, where we've got groups, organisations, projects in the organisation, Groups in an organisation, channels in an organisation, individuals in an organisation\u2014and each of these will have their own shared disc space. Each of these can also host a markdown web and blog. The README currently talks about our multi-layer network, which is very important and we want to emphasise that as well. But if we can show that this Communitas app is something like WhatsApp plus Slack plus Dropbox (but the next generation of that, something even better) that will be freely available and not tied to domain name systems, etc. The four-word networking is a way to make this network human readable (and should work for a considerable number of websites and whatnot). If we have to expand later to five words, we can, which would greatly extend the whole network space\u2014but at the moment, it's not required. So if we could do that and look at cleaning up any documentation to do with the Saoirse app or the Saoirse CLI, the P2P app, etc. \n\nAll we want to have left is the Communitas CLI and the Communitas Tauri app, as well as obviously the Saoirse core and all of the networking components\u2014but we don't really want any other apps.
