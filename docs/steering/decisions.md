## ADR-005: State Management Strategy

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context
Need to manage application state across React frontend and Rust backend.

### Decision
Use React Context API for frontend state, Rust ownership for backend state, with IPC for communication.

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Built-in React state management
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for state shape
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for small to medium applications
- **Separation**: Clear boundary between frontend and backend state

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- No additional dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe state management
- Straightforward debugging

**Negative:**
- Manual optimization needed for complex state
- No time-travel debugging
- Limited state persistence built-in

### Alternatives Considered

## ADR-006: Security Architecture

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context
Need comprehensive security model for handling sensitive community data.

### Decision
Implement multi-layer security with Tauri CSP, Rust memory safety, and cryptographic protocols.

### Rationale
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for data protection
- **Key Management**: Platform-specific secure storage

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Strong security posture
- Protection against common attacks
- Secure credential storage
