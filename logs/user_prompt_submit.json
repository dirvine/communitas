And within that packet, we can have things like the user can update it with the current forwards of the machine that they're on for direct communication (or it could be that it's used for a website publishing location), which we will use for each of the storage parts of our Communitas app. \n\nFor individuals, groups, organisations, projects, groups within the organisation, channels, individuals\u2014each of these can have their own identity packet, with these storage locations using the same four-word mechanism. \n\nIt's really the four words are used to capture a particular DHT packet. Using those four words and those four words only, the DHT should reject any ability to create a DHT packet that doesn't have four words recognised from our dictionary, where the hash of those four words is DHT identity.

Within the website or blog, they can have links to other forward identity packets for other people's website or blog.
